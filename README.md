# Project Agent

The Next.js app lives in the `project-agent-mvp` directory. Deploy to Vercel with this directory set as the root to avoid 404 errors.

## Assets

Binary images are not stored in this repository. SVG placeholders (e.g. `project-agent-mvp/public/avatar.svg`) are used so the repo remains text-only. Replace them with real images in production if needed.
